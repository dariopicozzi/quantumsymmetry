The qubits on which the symmetries act after the change of basis are called the **target qubits**. For example, if we are looking for a state that is in the -1 eigenstate of the $\\hat{P}_\\uparrow$ parity operator (that is we are interested in a state known to have an odd number of electrons with spin up), we will want to map $-Z_{2}Z_{0}$ to a one qubit Pauli $Z$ operator such as $Z_{0}$.

These two things together mean that on the states in the right eigensector, each Pauli term in the Hamiltonian acts just as the identity (after all, $Z|0⟩ = |0⟩$), and those qubits can be removed.\n",
